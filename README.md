### Description

Super simple addon to put bottom of selected at 0 in Z axis (_ground objects_) with or without offset on the selection.  
Because sometimes you just want that!  
Also you can _center objects_ on chosen world axis.

All of this is usefull to quickly place a model properly at the center of the scene for future linking.

Probably reinventing the wheel here, but as they say : better have options ;)


Options:

**Offset from active** : Consider only active object to move with all other objects following along (incompatible with individual mode)

**Individually** : Affect objects in selection individually instead of considering as a group
